# Shiny Apps: Development and Deployment
Shiny Apps allow developers and researchers to easily build interactive web applications only using the statistical software R. These apps allow R developer to interactively communicate their work to a broader audience in order to facilitate their outreach. Furthermore, Shiny comes with an extensive backend setup, users do not need web development skills to build and host standalone apps on a homepage. However, for those keen in building beautiful apps, Shiny apps allows for CSS, html and JavaScript extensions. In this workshop, I introduce the Shiny environment and show important features to develop Shiny apps which can be used either for data presentation, communication tool for results or even as interactive analytical tool. Using the example data sets by R, I introduce the distinction between front-end `ui.R` and back-end `server.R` required to build Shiny apps. Based upon this, I will introduce important concepts and features to build an interactive app, including control widgets, reactivity and rendering. In the last part of the workshop, I am going to introduce two ways of deploying Shiny Apps (letting them run in the world wide web), [https://www.shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) and [Shiny Server](https://rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/).
